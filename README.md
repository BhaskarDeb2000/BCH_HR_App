# HR-App

This is a small project on a simple HR-App. The app is designed to manage employees, departments, and job roles.

## Week 1 Features

### EmployeeCard Component:
Each employee is displayed in an EmployeeCard, which includes their name, role, and start date.

### EmployeeList Component:
The EmployeeList component renders multiple EmployeeCard components by passing employee details as props.
Promotion/Demotion Functionality:

Buttons are added to each employee card that allow users to promote or demote the employee's role within a predefined hierarchy of roles (Intern, Junior Developer, Developer, Senior Developer, Lead Developer).

### State Management:
React state is used to manage and update employee roles in the app.
